    <div class="main_body" style="width: 918px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">I
        am an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/applied-mathematics"

          target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://www.oit.edu"

          target="_blank">Oregon Institute of Technology</a>.</span> <span

        style="font-family: Century Gothic;">Before coming here, I was a <br />
        Visiting Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.math.utoledo.edu"

          target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu"

          target="_blank">University of Toledo, OH</a> from 2010 to 2013.<br />
        <br />
        I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://math.as.uky.edu/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>
        from the <a href="http://www.uky.edu" target="_blank">University of
          Kentucky</a> in August 2010, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/%7Eleep/"

          target="_blank">Prof. David Leep</a>. <br />
        My research interests are in Number Theory and Quadratic Forms. My
        Ph.D. thesis was titled "Diagonal Forms and Rationality of the <br />
        Poincar√© Series", which, loosely speaking, is the study of the
        number of solutions of a polynomial modulo powers of prime and the <br />
        power series that it generates.<br />
        <br />
        I did my undergraduate education -- B.S. (Hons.) in Mathematics from
        the <a href="http://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai
          Mathematical Institute</a>, India in 2004. <br />
