Before coming here, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toledo , OH from 2010 to 2013.  I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky in August 2010, under the supervision of Prof. David Leep . My research interests are in Number Theory and Quadratic Forms. My Ph.D. thesis was titled Diagonal Forms and Rationality of the Poincaré Series , which, loosely speaking, is the study of the number of solutions of a polynomial modulo powers of prime and the power series that it generates.  I did my undergraduate education -- B.S. (Hons.) in Mathematics from the Chennai Mathematical Institute , India in 2004.    Interests        Hiking      Crater Lake from Mt. Scott        Playing and making video games using the GameMaker Studio engine.    Watching Sports - NFL, Univ. of Kentucky Basketball, Cricket.
